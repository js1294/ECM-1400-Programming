# ECM-1400-Programming
This is my first programming module in my BSC Computer Science with Industrial Placement at Exeter University. This module was in python only. 
This module had three controlled assessments. These were CA1 (algorithm design in flowchart and psuedo code), CA2 (programming quiz), CA3 (Covid daily briefing project).
